<h1>Velocityvideogroup Website</h1>

<p>This is a website for the velocity video group, build with Laravel.</p>
<p>
It cointains somewhat like a CMS where you can embed YouTube videos, make new posts, register new employees for the about page and register new admins for your website (no user roles yet)! Also it cointains a contact file :)<br>

Everything's very simple and basic since it's my first Project with Laravel, but it was a lot of fun to build it!
